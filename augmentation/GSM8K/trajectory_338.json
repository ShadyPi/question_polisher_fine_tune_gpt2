In order to determine this, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total amount of gasoline consumed.\n\nBobby traveled to the supermarket, which was 5 miles away, and then back home, for a total distance of (5 miles + 5 miles) = 10 miles.\nNext, Bobby headed to his farm, which was 6 miles away. He drove 2 miles and then turned back, so the total distance traveled for this part of the journey is (2 miles + 2 miles + 6 miles) = 10 miles.\n\nThe total distance traveled is (10 miles + 10 miles) = 20 miles.\n\nBobby initially had 12 gallons of gasoline and now has 2 gallons left. Therefore, he consumed (12 gallons - 2 gallons) = 10 gallons of gasoline.\n\nTo calculate the rate of gasoline consumption, we divide the total distance traveled by the total amount of gasoline consumed:\nRate of gasoline consumption = 20 miles / 10 gallons = 2 miles per gallon.\n\nSo, the truck has been consuming gasoline at a rate of 2 miles per gallon.", "score": 1.0}, {"question": "Question: Bobby has a truck with a 12-gallon tank.
