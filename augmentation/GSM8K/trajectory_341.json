After sweeping, he cleared nine-tenths of the dust particles, leaving 1/10 of the dust particles remaining. Then, after walking across the porch, his shoes left 223 dust particles behind, resulting in a total of 331 dust particles. We need to determine the initial amount of dust particles on the porch (x).\n\nTherefore, the rewritten question is:\nSamuel swept the porch and removed nine-tenths of the dust particles. Afterwards, his shoes left 223 dust particles behind.
