She had a budget of $200 and spent a total of $30 on a shirt, $46 on pants, $38 on a coat, $11 on socks, and $18 on a belt. Additionally, she has $16 left from the budget. Let's find out how much she paid for the shoes.\n\nTo calculate the cost of the shoes, we need to subtract the amounts spent on the shirt, pants, coat, socks, belt, and the remaining budget from the total budget.\n\nTotal budget: $200\nAmount spent on the shirt: $30\nAmount spent on the pants: $46\nAmount spent on the coat: $38\nAmount spent on socks: $11\nAmount spent on the belt: $18\nRemaining budget: $16\n\nTotal amount spent: $30 + $46 + $38 + $11 + $18 + $16 = $159\n\nTherefore, Alexis paid $159 for the clothes, which means she paid $200 - $159 = $41 for the shoes.",
